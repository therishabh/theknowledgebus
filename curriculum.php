						<p>
							We serve a wide range of learners, from infants and toddlers, to primary and secondary students, to those studying at the tertiary and post-graduate levels. As an organisation, Knowledge Universe embraces diversity and, operating in different education sectors, in different countries, through different entities, using various modes of delivery, there is a multi-pronged approach to curriculum design and pedagogy.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, if there is a single common thread that runs throughout all Knowledge Universe® early childhood education centres, schools and colleges, it is a commitment to learner-centricity and an interactive, participative pedagogy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our early childhood curricula are conceived and developed by highly-qualified educators and curriculum specialists based on best-in-class global standards and practices. Innovative thinking and an unwavering commitment to the development of young learners’ potential means the Knowledge Universe® family of preschools are highly sought after wherever we operate.
						</p>
						<p>
							In keeping with modern constructivist learning theory, the educational philosophy that pervades all our institutions is that deep learning will only occur if students are actively engaged in constructing their own knowledge, as opposed to being passive recipients of information that typically leads to surface learning. In the words of John Seely Brown, it is important to provide opportunities for learners to create, reflect and share. Participation is a vital ingredient for effective learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, information and communication technologies play crucial roles in our lives, and it is important that these same technologies become an integral part of formal education to ensure the development of 21st century skills.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowledge Universe has considerable expertise in the area of educational technology and leverages this to good effect. Technology brings richness to the learning experience and can serve as a conduit for curious, lively, inquiring minds. Information is everywhere – literally and metaphorically at our fingertips – and this is changing the job of the educator. The objective now is to help ‘digital native’ students learn how to learn; to help them make sense of all this information, and convert it into knowledge and understanding.

									Knowledge Universe Chairman, Mike Milken, is a legendary financier widely known for innovations that helped create millions of jobs in the more than 3,200 companies he has financed since 1969. Milken is often said to have revolutionised modern capital markets, making them more democratic by expanding access to capital for these companies. The Washington Post said he "helped create the conditions for America's explosion of wealth and creativity," a process that Business Week said "shook America's defeatist Establishment out of its gloom." Today, he is an investor in several companies dedicated to enhancing learning from infancy through retirement.  The National Association of State Boards of Education honored him with the Friend of Education Award in 1997.
									</p>
									<p>
									A Fortune magazine cover story that chronicled his three decades of efforts to accelerate medical solutions referred to Mike as "The Man Who Changed Medicine.
